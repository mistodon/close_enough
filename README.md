Simple fuzzy-searching function and command line tool.


Installation
---

`cargo install close_enough`


### Installing the `ce` command

This is a `cd`-like command for fuzzily changing directories. See examples further down.

1.  Install `close_enough` as above
2.  Run `cle -ce-script bash > ce.sh` to generate the shell script
    - If you also want to use the `hop` command, you should use: `cle -ce-script bash --with-hop > ce.sh`
3.  Source `ce.sh` in your `.bashrc`, `.profile`, or similar

### Installing the `hop` command

This allows you to track recently used folders (you can define wrappers around `cd` or `ce` to do this automatically) and hop directly to them with a fuzzy match.

1.  Install `close_enough` as above
2.  Run `cle -hop-script bash > hop.sh` to generate the shell script
3.  Source `hop.sh` in your `.bashrc` etc.
